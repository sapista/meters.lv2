meters.lv2 - Audio Level Meters
===============================

===============================
This version is a fork with the goal of tweaking the GUI of the EBU R128 metter to make it fit better in my raspberrypi Display which is 1280x800 px.


===============================


meters.lv2 is a collection of audio-level meters with GUI in LV2 plugin format.

It includes needle style meters (mono and stereo variants)

*   IEC 60268-10 Type I / DIN
*   IEC 60268-10 Type I / Nordic
*   IEC 60268-10 Type IIa / BBC
*   IEC 60268-10 Type IIb / EBU
*   IEC 60268-17 / VU

Stereo & Mono variants of bar-graph meters:

*   30 Band 1/3 octave spectrum analyzer IEC 61260
*   Digital True-Peak Meter (4x Oversampling), Type II rise-time, 13.3dB/s falloff.
*   True-Peak (4x Oversampling) + RMS (600ms integration time) combined with numeric readout
*   K-12, K-14, K-20 / RMS type K-Meters according to the K-system introduced by Bob Katz
*   DR-14 (crest factor / loudness range measurement method)

and the following stereo plugins:

*   EBU R128 Meter with Histogram and History
*   Stereo Phase Correlation Meter (Needle Display)
*   BBC Mid/Side M-6 (Needle Display)
*   Goniometer (Stereo Phase Scope)
*   Phase/Frequency Wheel
*   Stereo/Frequency Monitor

as well as a mono:

*   Signal Distribution Histogram
*   Bitmeter

Usage
-----

Should be pretty much self-explanatory. A few notes:

* click + drag on the calibration-screw allows to modify the reference
	level of the needle meters
* shift + click on the calibration-screw resets to default
* ctrl + click on meters with scalable GUI resets the window-size to 100%
* clicking anywhere on the bar-graph meters resets the peak-hold

Install
-------

Compiling these plugin requires the LV2 SDK, gnu-make, a c-compiler,
libpango, libcairo and openGL (sometimes called: glu, glx, mesa).

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sapista/meters.lv2.git
  cd meters.lv2
  make submodules
  make
  sudo make install PREFIX=/usr
```

Note to packagers: The Makefile honors `PREFIX` and `DESTDIR` variables as well
as `CFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS` and `OPTIMIZATIONS` (additions to `CFLAGS`), also
see the first 10 lines of the Makefile.
You really want to package the superset of [x42-plugins](https://github.com/x42/x42-plugins).


Note on build-dependencies
--------------------------

These plugins count on rather recent (Jan 2013) fixes^Wfeatures of
some libraries (but may work with older versions too):

In particular multi-threading in cairo, pixman and pango.
Versions of those libraries earlier than libcairo < 1.12.10,
libpixman < 0.30.2 and libpango < 1.32.6 are not thread-safe.
As with all concurrency issues, things may or may not work and
if you only open one meter GUI at a time it's usually fine.

Also note that the plugins use the LV2 idle-interface (lv2 >= 1.4.2)
The plugin-host (eg. ardour or qtractor) needs to be compiled with
this or a later version of the LV2 SDK to support the features.

The plugin-host must also support http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/resize-port/
